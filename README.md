# Fiat Swap

### TL;DR

This contract allows token sellers to put their tokens into a contract, which only releases the tokens to someone who can prove that they appropriately paid the seller on some traditional digital payment service (such as Venmo, MPesa, Zelle, CashApp, PayPal...) that takes care of handling the fiat payments, as well as KYC and AML compliance. The current proof-of-concept only supports Venmo so far. The goal is to allow anyone to freely swap between local currency inside a verified fiat account, and tokens on the blockchain. 

This is a key building block needed to provide financial products (such as insurance, loans or savings accounts) to anyone in the world via the blockchain: anyone who receives capital from a smart contract could use it to do things in the fiat-world, and anyone who wants to deposit capital into smart contracts could do so - as long they use the same payment service as some individual who's willing to swap between crypto and fiat, even if the two don't trust each other.

Here are some exciting ways anyone could improve the contract: Add more fiat payment services. Design a market which efficiently matches buyers with sellers, maybe by finding a way to create the role of liquidity providers as in [Uniswap](https://uniswap.com/) for example. Integrate with [OpenGSN](https://opengsn.org/) to allow the token-buyer to start without any ETH in their wallet, enabling a trustless fiat-crypto onramp (directly onto L2!). 

### The big picture
There's a lot of spare capital parked on Ethereum. People decided to put it there because they have high hopes for the potential of the technology, and now they would love to put it to productive (and interest-earning) use. For now, there are only few "productive" use-cases for capital in the blockchain world: align the incentives of consensus participants via proof-of-stake, or provide liquidity that allows users to swap tokens, for example. But if we're honest, there's almost no way right now in which this capital could be put to productive use in the _real world_, i.e. to solve problems that have existed before blockchains came around. The consequence: people mostly use their capital to speculate on the prices of NTFs, ERC20s and other tokens. We think this falls fundamentally short of what blockchain capital - globally available and with perfect contractual security built-in - _could_ be used for: rent it out or provide insurance for those who are neglected by existing financial and legal institutions, such as people in low income countries. 

But we're missing some key pieces to realize this vision: transactions must become cheaper without reducing the trustworthiness of the system (shout out to Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon and ZKSync for working on this!). We also need to empower people to prove that they never defaulted on a loan (which we enable with [Proof-Of-ID](https://app.opencontracts.io/#/open-contracts/proof-of-id) for example, but also shoutout to the [Proof-Of-Humanity](https://www.proofofhumanity.id/) project!). And finally, we need to make crypto capital easily convertible into local fiat-currencry, wherever you are. And that's what this contract is about.
