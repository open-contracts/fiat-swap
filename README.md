# Fiat Swap




### Here's a macro problem
There's a lot of spare capital parked on Ethereum. People decided to put it there because they have high hopes for the potential of the technology, and now they would love to put it to productive (and interest-earning) use. For now, there are only few "productive" use-cases for capital in the blockchain world: align the incentives of consensus participants via proof-of-stake, or provide liquidity that allows users to swap tokens, for example. But if we're honest, there's almost no way right now in which this capital could be put to productive use in the _real world_, i.e. to solve problems that have existed before blockchains came around. The consequence: people mostly use their capital to speculate on the prices of NTFs, ERC20s and other tokens. We think this falls fundamentally short of what capital on Ethereum could do, short of what's inspiring about smart contracts in the first place. 

build a future where anyone with spare cash in rich countries can provide capital or insurance to small businesses owners in low income countries!
